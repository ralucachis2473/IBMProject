Check-in platform for attending classes by keeping a safe distance 

The application provides the possibility to add students and classrooms (including the
maximum capacity in order to keep a safe distance).The classes will also be defined as taking
place in a certain classroom at a certain date and time period and students can register for a
certain class and date. When the maximum capacity is reached, registering is not possible
anymore. The application displays a list of classes and classrooms along with occupancy rate for
a time period.
